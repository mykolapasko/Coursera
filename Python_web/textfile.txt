Azerbaijan has announced a "unilateral ceasefire" in fighting with Armenian forces over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. 
A defence ministry spokesman said the Azeris were acting in response to international calls to halt violence. 
But the Armenia-backed Karabakh forces said this was false and Azerbaijan was continuing to fire shells. 
Nagorno-Karabakh has been in the hands of ethnic-Armenian separatists since a war that ended in 1994. 
Fighting had continued into Sunday, after clashes left 30 soldiers dead and caused civilian casualties.
